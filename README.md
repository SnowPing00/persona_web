# Persona Workspace v1.0

A secure, local-first web desktop environment built with C++ and modern web technologies. This project demonstrates a powerful combination of a native C++ backend and a dynamic JavaScript frontend to create a sandboxed workspace within your browser.



## üí° Core Concepts

* **Local-First Principle**: All user data is stored exclusively on the user's local machine in a dedicated virtual drive (`C:\PersonaRoot`), ensuring complete data sovereignty and privacy.
* **Secure Sandbox**: The application operates within a secure sandbox. The frontend can only interact with files inside the virtual drive through a strictly controlled C++ backend API.
* **Modular App System**: New applications (viewers, editors, etc.) can be easily added by creating a new folder with a `manifest.json` file, without modifying the core application code.
* **Dynamic UI**: The user interface is built on Golden Layout, allowing users to drag, drop, resize, and manage windows to create their own personalized workspace.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Multi-Window UI**: A fully customizable desktop environment powered by Golden Layout.
* **Virtual File Explorer**: Browse and interact with files and directories within your secure local virtual drive.
* **App Browser**: Discover and view information about installed applications.
* **Smart File Handling**:
    * **"Open With..." Dialog**: If multiple apps can open a file, a selection dialog is presented.
    * **Persistent Default Apps**: The system remembers your app choice for each file type for quick access.
    * **Context Menu**: A hamburger menu on each file allows you to explicitly choose which app to open it with.
* **Secure C++ Backend**: A multi-threaded web server handles all file operations, app discovery, and serves the frontend.
* **Safety Features**: Includes close confirmation dialogs and prevents closing essential windows to avoid accidental data loss.

## üîß Prerequisites & Setup

Before running the application, you **must** create a specific folder on your `C:` drive. This folder will act as the root of the Persona Virtual Drive.

1.  **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator.**
2.  **Create the directory by running the following command:**

    ```bash
    mkdir C:\PersonaRoot
    ```

This directory is required for all file-related operations. Without it, the server-side file APIs will fail.
